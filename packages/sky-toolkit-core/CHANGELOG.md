# Changelog

`sky-toolkit-core` follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to help manage the impact of releasing new library versions.


## 2.7.0

### Fixes

    numbers; functionality that isn't available in Sass by default.


## 2.6.0

> Woah! What the hell happened between `2.1.4` and `2.6.0`? üò±

Chill out, there's nothing to worry about. ‚ùÑÔ∏è

We've just reverted the way we use [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) within our monorepo‚Ä¶

* [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) changed from `independent` to `fixed` for all Toolkit packages.


## 2.1.4

## 2.1.2

### Fixes

  hidden by Toolkit's `body` overflow.


## 2.1.1

### Features

  link‚Äîhosted on our CDN‚Äîthrough the entry point. Automatically 
  version-controlled to correspond to your app's version of Toolkit in 
  `package.json`.
  
  For usage information, see [Toolkit's `README.md`](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#hybrid).


## 2.0.0

### Features

* [Colors] `grey-40` modified to meet AA accessibility.

    * `@include gradient-background()` refactored to support color stop percentages rather than start and end values.
    * `@include gradient-background()` now supports custom `background-color` fallbacks.
    * `@include gradient-text()` add customisable gradient text fills using the gradients map.
    * `gradient-color-stops()` function to fetch a list of gradient color stop percentages and values.
* [Objects]
    * `.o-list-inline` now aligns with [Supercell](https://github.com/sky-uk/supercell)] modifiers; featuring `--flush`, `--narrow` and `--wide` spacing.

### Dependencies

  checks show everything is A-okay, but be vigilant‚Äîand inexplicable and/or
  subtle rendering issues might be caused by this change.

### Deprecations

* [Gradients]
    * `gradient()` function renamed to `gradient-color()`.
    * Removal of `@include page-background()`, please use:
        * `@include gradient-background(page, horizontal)` instead for the **large** page background gradient, or
        * `@include gradient-background(page-small, horizontal)` instead for the **small** page background gradient.
    * Refactor of `@include gradient-background()`'s `horizontal` option to output the percentages defined, rather than "end start end" values.
    * `large` gradient renamed to `default`.
    * `small` gradient renamed to `highlight`.
    * `mid` gradient renamed to `tile`.
* [Objects]
    * `.o-media--small` renamed to `.o-media--narrow`.

        * `$global-spacing-unit-tiny` to `$global-spacing-unit-small`
    * **Classes** - if used in your project, you may want to consider changing the following:
