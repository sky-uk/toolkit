  link‚Äîhosted on our CDN‚Äîthrough the entry point. Automatically
  version-controlled to correspond to your app's version of Toolkit in
  `package.json`.

  For usage information, see [Toolkit's `README.md`](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#hybrid).


## 2.0.0

### Features

  subtle rendering issues might be caused by this change.

    * `gradient()` function renamed to `gradient-color()`.

        * `@include gradient-background(page-small, horizontal)` instead for the **small** page background gradient.
